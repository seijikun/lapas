# The home folder of a user consists of two layers. The base layer and the user layer.
# The base layer is below the user layer and contains data that all users share.
# Generally, users can make changes to files in the base layer.
# Those changes are specific to the user as they are layered on top of base to "overshadow" it.

# Before the two layers are put together, a cleanup process runs across both of them.
# This file contains an ordered list of rules for files and folders, to decide
# whether they should be kept or deleted during cleanup in the corresponding layers (base / user)
# Essentially, the purpose of this file is thus to describe the two masks as shown in the diagram.
# You can compare it to a .gitignore file
#
# Each rule consist of a match-pattern and the two corresponding actions for the two layers:
# - base defines what to do with matching files from the base layer
# - user defines what to do with matching files from the user layer
# Rules have the following format:
# >> base:{keep,delete} user:{keep,delete} {pattern} <<
# They MUST NOT contain comments on the same line!
#
# Each rule has the power to "overrule" all of its predecessors if it matches the same file again
# It is thus possible to first state a more general rule, then create exceptions for it



# Default rule - all following rules are basically exceptions changing this default behavior
# --------------------------------------------------------
# Per default, delete everything from base (you have to explicitly mark files that the base layer brings to the table)
# Per default, keep everything from user (you have to explicitly mark files that users must never make permanent changes to)
base:delete user:keep **


# Proper default KDE6 setup for new users

# Always provided by base
# User-specific changes are forbidden and rolled back on any login

# Always provided by base
# User-specific changes are forbidden and rolled back on any login
