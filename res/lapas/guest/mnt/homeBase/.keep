# The home folder of a user consists of two layers. The base layer and the user layer.
# The base layer is below the user layer and contains data that all users share.
# Generally, users can make changes to files in the base layer.
# Those changes are specific to the user as they are layered on top of base to "overshadow" it.

# Before the two layers are put together, a cleanup process runs across both of them.
# This file contains an ordered list of rules for files and folders, to decide
# whether they should be kept or deleted during cleanup in the corresponding layers (base / user)
# Essentially, the purpose of this file is thus to describe the two masks as shown in the diagram.
# You can compare it to a .gitignore file
#
# Each rule consist of a match-pattern and the two corresponding actions for the two layers:
# - base defines what to do with matching files from the base layer
# - user defines what to do with matching files from the user layer
# Rules have the following format:
# >> base:{keep,delete} user:{keep,delete} {pattern} <<
# They MUST NOT contain comments on the same line!
#
# Each rule has the power to "overrule" all of its predecessors if it matches the same file again
# It is thus possible to first state a more general rule, then create exceptions for it



# Default rule - all following rules are basically exceptions changing this default behavior
# --------------------------------------------------------
# Per default, delete everything from base (you have to explicitly mark files that the base layer brings to the table)
# Per default, keep everything from user (you have to explicitly mark files that users must never make permanent changes to)
base:delete user:keep **


# Proper default XFCE setup for new users
# --------------------------------------------------------
# Initially provided by base
# But users can make permanent changes to them
base:keep user:keep .config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml
base:keep user:keep .config/xfce4/panel


# Application starters (desktop files)
# --------------------------------------------------------
# Always provided by base
# User-specific changes are forbidden and rolled back on any login
base:keep user:delete .local/share/applications


# Folder with LAPAS-Distribution specific stuff like scripts
# --------------------------------------------------------
# Always provided by base
# User-specific changes are forbidden and rolled back on any login
base:keep user:delete .lapas


# Environment Setup
# --------------------------------------------------------
# Always provided by base
# User-specific changes are forbidden and rolled back on any login
base:keep user:delete .bashrc
base:keep user:delete .bash_profile


# LAPAS WineManager
# --------------------------------------------------------
# The wine bottles are always provided by base - users can only overwrite userspecific files, such as
# the user registry and userdata (that lapasWineManager mounts to outside the wine prefix)
base:keep user:delete .wineManager
# user specific files
base:delete user:keep .wineManager/bottles/*/prefix/user.reg
base:delete user:keep .wineManager/bottles/*/prefix/userdef.reg
base:delete user:keep .wineManager/userdata
