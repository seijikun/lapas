This folder contains extracted lutris runtime archives.
You can get Lutris runners from:

https://lutris.net/api/runners

The wine runner urls should look something like this:
> https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/wine-ge-custom/releases/download/GE-Proton7-35/wine-lutris-GE-Proton7-35-x86_64.tar.xz
Just download and extract them into the runners folder, then you can configure the foldername in the corresponding game's
bottle.conf file.
