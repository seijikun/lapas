This folder contains helper scripts with functions in them that
will be imported and are available to you in your game/shortcut hooks.
You should prefix all methods in here with helper and the helper's name.
So if the helper-script is called messagebox.sh, all contained methods should follow
something like the following naming scheme:
helperMessageboxMethodA
helperMessageboxMethodB
to avoid naming collisions
